<h1 align="center"> Calculate Almond Yield and Create a Profit Model<h1>

## Project Motivation

For this assignment provided in our EDS 230 Environmental Modeling class, the goals were to:

- Implement a simple model of almond yield anomaly response to climate.
  - Draw a diagram to represent your model - how it will translate inputs to outputs, with parameters that shape the relationship between inputs and outputs. 
  - Implement your diagram as an R function.

- Develop a profit model for your almond yield.
  - Do a simple informal sensitivity analysis of almond yield profit using at least 2 parameters.
  - Create a single graph of the results.
