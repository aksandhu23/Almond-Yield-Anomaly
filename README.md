<h1 align="center"> Calculate Almond Yield and Create a Profit Model<h1>

![image](https://github.com/aksandhu23/Assignment2/blob/main/Almonds.jpg)

## Project Motivation

For this assignment provided in our EDS 230 Environmental Modeling class, the goals were to:

- Implement a simple model of almond yield anomaly response to climate.
  - Draw a diagram to represent your model - how it will translate inputs to outputs, with parameters that shape the relationship between inputs and outputs. 
  - Implement your diagram as an R function.

- Develop a profit model for your almond yield.
  - Do a simple informal sensitivity analysis of almond yield profit using at least 2 parameters.
  - Create a single graph of the results.
  
 ## This repository contains the following files: 
 ### Files:
- HW2.Rmd: Read in the climate data to test the almond yield function
- HW3.Rmd: An example of how to use the profit model containing plots of the results
- almond_yield_function.R: Almond yield as a function to calculate the anomaly in acres per ton
- profit_model.R: Profit model function for almond yield anomaly
- clim.txt: The dataset used to conduct analysis
- EDS230_Diagram.pdf: An initial diagram of the almond yield anomaly model
